## Conclusions and Recommendations

Based on the optimization results, we can draw the following conclusions:

1. **Optimal State Count**: 5 states provide the best balance between model complexity and performance.
2. **Discretization Strategy**: Equal-frequency binning works best for this financial data.
3. **Feature Selection**: The high-low spread is a strong predictor for market regimes.
4. **Direct State Correlation**: Using direct state correlation with market regimes improves classification accuracy.

For further improvements, we recommend:

1. **Feature Engineering**: Explore additional technical indicators as features.
2. **Ensemble Approach**: Combine HMM predictions with other models like LSTM or GRU networks.
3. **Adaptive Discretization**: Implement adaptive binning strategies that adjust to market volatility.
4. **Online Learning**: Implement online learning to adapt the model to changing market conditions.
